# Weightlifting Performance Predictor: A Data-Driven Approach
This project explores the use of machine learning to predict Snatch and Clean & Jerk lifts for weightlifters. Here's a breakdown of the approach:
# Data Collection and Exploration:
1.Athlete Data: A comprehensive dataset was meticulously crafted by collecting information on elite weightlifters from various sources like YouTube, Instagram, and Wikipedia.<br>
2.Feature Engineering: This dataset included features like front squat, back squat numbers, Snatch Max, Clean & Jerk Max, and weight.<br>
3.Excel Analysis: The data was initially organized and analyzed in Excel. Techniques like conditional formatting, pivot tables, and referencing were employed to streamline the process. Additionally, the Sinclare score, a weightlifting performance metric, was calculated for each athlete.
# Machine Learning with Python:
1.Linear Regression: Python was used to import the data and build a machine learning model. Linear regression was chosen as the initial approach to predict Snatch and Clean & Jerk lifts.<br>
2.Data Visualization: Leveraging Matplotlib, the project investigated linear trends between back squat and Snatch, as well as front squat and Clean & Jerk. These insights were visually represented through scatter plots.<br>
3.Further Exploration: Beyond the initial analysis, various graphs and visualizations were generated to delve deeper into the weightlifting data.
# Project Focus:
While initially conceived as a personal tool to track weightlifting progress, the project's potential for broader application led to the consideration of uploading it to GitHub.
# Potential Enhancements:
This project lays a solid foundation for future exploration. Here are some possibilities:

1.Model Selection: Exploring alternative machine learning algorithms like decision trees or random forests could potentially capture more complex relationships between features.<br>
2.Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on existing ones could further enhance model performance.<br>
3.Deployment: Deploying the model as a web application could allow users to input their data and receive personalized predictions.<br>

Overall, this project demonstrates the effective use of data collection, data analysis, and machine learning to gain insights into weightlifting performance. By building upon this foundation, the project can be further refined and customized for broader applications in the weightlifting community.
